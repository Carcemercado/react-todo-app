# React todo list app

This app will be used to practice working with Material UI, React, and command line Git repository update.

These are the tools being used to create the project:

- [@Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design. It's comprehensive and can be used in production out of the box.
- [@React](https://react.dev/learn) uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) for scaffolding the React app.
- [@Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) uses the AI code editor for VIBE coding.

## This application is meant to practice working with React and JavaScript frameworks.

The application will have continuous development as functionality is added.
